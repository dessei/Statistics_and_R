# Statistics and R
## Motivation
I recently got interested in R and I was looking to relearn some statistics (as I maybe didn't care about that as much as I should have while 'learning' about it in university) basics to better be able to actually use and understand Rs capabilities.
## Goal
This fun little side project will be me using the priciples explained in this [FreeCodeCamp video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxpc-HPKN28) in R and just combining the theory shown there with how I'd actually use them in practice.

If you stumbled upon this feel free to look around. If you're a beginner in R as well you there is at least the chance of you finding some interesting snippets here and there.
